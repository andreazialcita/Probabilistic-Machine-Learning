<h1>Probabilistic Machine Learning</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a compilation of the codes I produced and submitted as part of my junior-year Probabilistic Machine Learning class. Each topic was introduced through a discussion of its underlying mathematical theory, followed by coding lectures and exercises to implement the concepts in practice.

- <b>Linear Regression </b> (Least Squares Estimate and Maximum Likelihood Estimate)

- <b>Regularization</b> (Ridge and Lasso)

- <b>Kernel Functions</b>

- <b>Bayesian Approach to Regression</b>

- <b>Logistic Regression</b>

- <b>Gaussian Discriminant Analysis</b>

- <b>Support Vector Machines</b>

<h2>Languages Used</h2>
- <b>Python </b> 

<h2>Libraries Used </h2>

- <b>NumPy</b>
- <b>Pandas</b>
- <b>Matplotlib</b>
- <b>scikit-learn</b>
- <b>Scipy</b>
